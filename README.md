# dronebase

A bare-bones RCON client library for Battlefield 4 (or any other recent
Battlefield title, if you care to make some minor adjustments). Made for those
wishing to spare themselves all the pain associated with Procon, with no
compromises, other than, well, having to code the rules yourself, instead of
relying on bloated, over-complicated and often bugged third-party plugins.

### Usage

### Example

### Story

This was intended to be a part of something much bigger, but that bigger
*something* failed to go through our quick feasibility study, so it ended up
being abandoned =/ [What it looked like moments before being
archived.](http://i.imgur.com/PBDRH4m.png)

Special thanks to [Alexander Korotkikh](https://github.com/AKorotkikh) AKA
